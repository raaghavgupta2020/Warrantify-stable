## 🧐 Problem at hand 
- The blockchain smart contract should allow users to prove ownership 
- Provide the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information
- The warranty card should include the item’s serial number and upon purchase be sent to the customer’s smartphone.
- The NFTs should be decaying in nature, in that, after a certain period their use for the redemption of warranty benefits offered by the brand/retailer will expire
- Bonus - GUI-based tool that doesn’t require knowledge of any Blockchain programming to use by Brands and Retailers.
- Bonus - Usage of Soulbound NFTs
- Bonus - Add any engagement/gamification construct to the loyalty program


## ⚒️ About The Project
We have built a dApp on top of the ethereum ecosystem by which content creators could mint their own NFTs and sell on our platform with just a little listing proce of 0.025 eth. 
The users can donate to the organisations as well , which are posting NGO merchendises ( like street animals safety etc ) 
Users can avail many of the perks such as access to exclusive video NFTs.

## 🙌🏻 Our Solution
### Middleman Deduction
- Easier monetization for the companiesand user-friendly management services.

### Decentralized video storage means less censorship
- Decentralized video storage allows video to
be passed between users, free from the
restrictions of any one platform. This will
likely help creators bypass censorship,
allowing them to share and monetize
content that might not be accepted by
YouTube or Instagram.

### A new way to build up a fanbase before the video is released
- Releasing posters or exclusive scenes as NFTs before a video or movie is released can build hype around the project.

### Another way to release exclusive editions like in the blockbuster days
- While the days of exclusive edition dvds are behind us, NFTs provide a new format for releasing special versions of videos and films by the content creators.
