## 🧐 Problem at hand 

Nowdays underrated youtubers and content
creators face many problems while making
content as they have to give their most of the
revenue to their repested platform which
makes it difficult for them to carry forward
their passion and do social work.

## ⚒️ About The Project
We have built a dApp on top of the ethereum ecosystem by which content creators could mint their own NFTs and sell it to their fanbase. The users can also donate these creators and avail many of the perks such as access to exclusive video NFTs.

## 🙌🏻 Our Solution
### Middleman Deduction
- Easier monetization for smaller YouTube
creators and user-friendly management
services.
### Decentralized video storage means less censorship
- Decentralized video storage allows video to
be passed between users, free from the
restrictions of any one platform. This will
likely help creators bypass censorship,
allowing them to share and monetize
content that might not be accepted by
YouTube or Instagram.
### A new way to build up a fanbase before the video is released
- Releasing posters or exclusive scenes as NFTs before a video or movie is released can build hype around the project.
### Another way to release exclusive editions like in the blockbuster days
- While the days of exclusive edition dvds are behind us, NFTs provide a new format for releasing special versions of videos and films by the content creators.
